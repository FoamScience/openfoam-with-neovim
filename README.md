# OpenFOAM editing with NeoVIM

> This is based on [Hugo-reveal](https://github.com/dzello/reveal-hugo),
> so if anything works there, it works here
>
> I simply added interactive images, Tikz support,
> and a way to highlight OpenFOAM code

To get things running:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/FoamScience/openfoam-with-neovim
cd openfoam-with-neovim
hugo server
```
